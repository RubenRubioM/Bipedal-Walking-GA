"MP43JD76","book","2013","Bjarne Stroustrup","A Tour of C++","","978-0-321-95831-0","","","","The C++11 standard allows programmers to express ideas more clearly, simply, and directly, and to write faster, more efficient code. Bjarne Stroustrup, the designer and original implementer of C++, thoroughly covers the details of this language and its use in his definitive reference, The C++ Programming Language, Fourth Edition. In A Tour of C++, Stroustrup excerpts the overview chapters from that complete reference, expanding and enhancing them to give an experienced programmer-in just a few hours-a clear idea of what constitutes modern C++. In this concise, self-contained guide, Stroustrup covers most major language features and the major standard-library components-not, of course, in great depth, but to a level that gives programmers a meaningful overview of the language, some key examples, and practical help in getting started. Stroustrup presents the C++ features in the context of the programming styles they support, such as object-oriented and generic programming. His tour is remarkably comprehensive. Coverage begins with the basics, then ranges widely through more advanced topics, including many that are new in C++11, such as move semantics, uniform initialization, lambda expressions, improved containers, random numbers, and concurrency. The tour ends with a discussion of the design and evolution of C++ and the extensions added for C++11. This guide does not aim to teach you how to program (see Stroustrup's Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++ for that); nor will it be the only resource you'll need for C++ mastery (see Stroustrup's The C++ Programming Language, Fourth Edition, for that). If, however, you are a C or C++ programmer wanting greater familiarity with the current C++ language, or a programmer versed in another language wishing to gain an accurate picture of the nature and benefits of modern C++, you can't find a shorter or simpler introduction than this tour provides.","2013-10-03","2020-10-28 22:21:04","2020-10-30 11:42:33","","","192","","","","","","","","","","","Upper Saddle River, NJ","Inglés","","","","","Amazon","","","","","https://www.amazon.es/Tour-C-Depth/dp/0321958314","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"X9HUY43C","book","1998","Melanie Mitchell","An Introduction to Genetic Algorithms","","978-0-262-63185-3","","","","Genetic algorithms have been used in science and engineering as adaptive algorithms for solving practical problems and as computational models of natural evolutionary systems. This brief, accessible introduction describes some of the most interesting research in the field and also enables readers to implement and experiment with genetic algorithms on their own. It focuses in depth on a small set of important and interesting topics--particularly in machine learning, scientific modeling, and artificial life--and reviews a broad span of research, including the work of Mitchell and her colleagues. The descriptions of applications and modeling projects stretch beyond the strict boundaries of computer science to include dynamical systems theory, game theory, molecular biology, ecology, evolutionary biology, and population genetics, underscoring the exciting ""general purpose"" nature of genetic algorithms as search methods that can be employed across disciplines. An Introduction to Genetic Algorithms is accessible to students and researchers in any scientific discipline. It includes many thought and computer exercises that build on and reinforce the reader's understanding of the text. The first chapter introduces genetic algorithms and their terminology and describes two provocative applications in detail. The second and third chapters look at the use of genetic algorithms in machine learning (computer programs, data analysis and prediction, neural networks) and in scientific models (interactions among learning, evolution, and culture; sexual selection; ecosystems; evolutionary activity). Several approaches to the theory of genetic algorithms are discussed in depth in the fourth chapter. The fifth chapter takes up implementation, and the last chapter poses some currently unanswered questions and surveys prospects for the future of evolutionary computation.","1998","2020-10-30 11:33:33","2020-10-30 11:42:42","","","226","","","","","","","","","","MIT Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.es/books?id=0eznlz0TF-IC","","Computers / Intelligence (AI) & Semantics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most of the work has followed traditional GA philosophy when choosing the population size and mutation rate of the genetic algorithm. This paper reports the results of experiments to determine the optimum population size and mutation rate for a simple real genetic algorithm. The choice of population size and mutation rate can cause the run time of the GA to vary by several orders of magnitude. The results of this investigation show that a small population size and relatively large mutation rate is far superior to the large population sizes and low mutation rates that is used by most of the papers presented in the electromagnetics community and by the GA community at large. The results of the numerical experiments presented in this paper suggest that the best mutation rate for GAs lies between 5 and 20% while the population size should be less than 16.","2000-07","2020-11-06 09:17:14","2020-11-06 09:17:36","","1034-1037 vol.2","","","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","C:\Users\ruben\Zotero\storage\VSI7MX7Y\Haupt - 2000 - Optimum population size and mutation rate for a si.pdf; C:\Users\ruben\Zotero\storage\9GGUGU9B\875398.html","","","antenna phased arrays; antenna radiation patterns; Application software; array factors; Displays; Electromagnetics; electromagnetics problems; Explosions; genetic algorithm; genetic algorithms; Genetic algorithms; Genetic mutations; Helium; linear antenna array; linear antenna arrays; numerical experiments; optimum mutation rate; optimum population size; phase weights; Phased arrays; run time; sidelobe level; simple real genetic algorithm; Vectors; Wheels","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium.

Like other artificial intelligence techniques, evolutionary algorithms will likely see increased use and development due to the increased availability of computation, more robust and available open source software libraries, and the increasing demand for artificial intelligence techniques. As these techniques become more adopted and capable, it is the right time to take a perspective of their ability to integrate into society and the human processes they intend to augment. In this review, we explore a new taxonomy of evolutionary algorithms and resulting classifications that look at five main areas: the ability to manage the control of the environment with limiters, the ability to explain and repeat the search process, the ability to understand input and output causality within a solution, the ability to manage algorithm bias due to data or user design, and lastly, the ability to add corrective measures. These areas are motivated by today's pressures on industry to conform to both societies concerns and new government regulatory rules. As many reviews of evolutionary algorithms exist, after motivating this new taxonomy, we briefly classify a broad range of algorithms and identify areas of future research.","2019-06-03","2020-11-08 12:05:56","2020-11-29 10:51:46","2020-11-08 12:05:56","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv: 1906.08870","","C:\Users\ruben\Zotero\storage\JYQSIS8E\Sloss y Gustafson - 2019 - 2019 Evolutionary Algorithms Review.pdf; C:\Users\ruben\Zotero\storage\A4GXGM4F\1906.html","","","Computer Science - Machine Learning; Computer Science - Neural and Evolutionary Computing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This means that the market behaves as a random walk and as a result makes forecasting impossible. Furthermore, financial forecasting is a difficult task due to the intrinsic complexity of the financial system. The objective of this work was to use artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to model and predict the future price of a stock market index. Three artificial intelligence techniques, namely, neural networks (NN), support vector machines and neuro-fuzzy systems are implemented in forecasting the future price of a stock market index based on its historical price information. Artificial intelligence techniques have the ability to take into consideration financial system complexities and they are used as financial time series forecasting tools. Two techniques are used to benchmark the AI techniques, namely, Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) which is linear modelling technique and random walk (RW) technique. The experimentation was performed on data obtained from the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. The data used was a series of past closing prices of the All Share Index. The results showed that the three techniques have the ability to predict the future price of the Index with an acceptable accuracy. All three artificial intelligence techniques outperformed the linear model. However, the random walk method outperfomed all the other techniques. These techniques show an ability to predict the future price however, because of the transaction costs of trading in the market, it is not possible to show that the three techniques can disprove the weak form of market efficiency. The results show that the ranking of performances support vector machines, neuro-fuzzy systems, multilayer perceptron neural networks is dependent on the accuracy measure used.","2010","2020-11-13 12:19:26","2020-11-29 10:42:48","","166","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\ruben\Zotero\storage\VAPXP46E\Marwala - Forecasting the Stock Market Index Using Artificia.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This versatility is achieved by trying to avoid task-specific engineering and therefore disregarding a lot of prior knowledge. Instead of exploiting man-made input features carefully optimized for each task, our system learns internal representations on the basis of vast amounts of mostly unlabeled training data. This work is then used as a basis for building a freely available tagging system with good performance and minimal computational requirements.","2011-11-01","2020-11-21 10:05:49","2020-11-21 10:05:49","","2493–2537","","null","12","","J.

One of the critical stages in the genetic algorithm is a crossover process. In the crossover, phase occurs the gene mix between the parent that it will determine the  diversity in the population. This paper will describe the effects of the alpha parameter in the crossover process  which includes arithmetic crossover and heuristic crossover. The Case studies that used in this study is the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The influence of parameters on the performance of genetic algorithm alpha  is associated with gene diversity resulting from the crossover. The results showed that in the arithmetic  crossover, the best alpha value is 0.5, becoming the best alpha value because of a balanced genes combination  from both parents. On Heuristic Crossover obtained different results where the alpha value which gives the best performance is 0.9. This method slightly different from the Arithmetic Crossover caused on Heuristic  Crossover; the alpha parameter used as multiplier factor after the subtraction process of genes from both  parents.","2017","2020-11-24 08:52:21","2020-11-29 10:52:13","2020-11-24 08:52:21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\ruben\Zotero\storage\777JKTPV\903dce68eb97f50c3993305100c95d8607d1e459.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
