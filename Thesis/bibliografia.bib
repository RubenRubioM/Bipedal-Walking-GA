Bjarne Stroustrup, the designer and original implementer of C++, thoroughly covers the details of this language and its use in his definitive reference, The C++ Programming Language, Fourth Edition. In A Tour of C++, Stroustrup excerpts the overview chapters from that complete reference, expanding and enhancing them to give an experienced programmer-in just a few hours-a clear idea of what constitutes modern C++. In this concise, self-contained guide, Stroustrup covers most major language features and the major standard-library components-not, of course, in great depth, but to a level that gives programmers a meaningful overview of the language, some key examples, and practical help in getting started. Stroustrup presents the C++ features in the context of the programming styles they support, such as object-oriented and generic programming. His tour is remarkably comprehensive. Coverage begins with the basics, then ranges widely through more advanced topics, including many that are new in C++11, such as move semantics, uniform initialization, lambda expressions, improved containers, random numbers, and concurrency. The tour ends with a discussion of the design and evolution of C++ and the extensions added for C++11. This guide does not aim to teach you how to program (see Stroustrup's Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++ for that); nor will it be the only resource you'll need for C++ mastery (see Stroustrup's The C++ Programming Language, Fourth Edition, for that). If, however, you are a C or C++ programmer wanting greater familiarity with the current C++ language, or a programmer versed in another language wishing to gain an accurate picture of the nature and benefits of modern C++, you can't find a shorter or simpler introduction than this tour provides.},

	abstract = {Genetic algorithms have been used in science and engineering as adaptive algorithms for solving practical problems and as computational models of natural evolutionary systems. This brief, accessible introduction describes some of the most interesting research in the field and also enables readers to implement and experiment with genetic algorithms on their own. It focuses in depth on a small set of important and interesting topics--particularly in machine learning, scientific modeling, and artificial life--and reviews a broad span of research, including the work of Mitchell and her colleagues. The descriptions of applications and modeling projects stretch beyond the strict boundaries of computer science to include dynamical systems theory, game theory, molecular biology, ecology, evolutionary biology, and population genetics, underscoring the exciting "general purpose" nature of genetic algorithms as search methods that can be employed across disciplines. An Introduction to Genetic Algorithms is accessible to students and researchers in any scientific discipline. It includes many thought and computer exercises that build on and reinforce the reader's understanding of the text. The first chapter introduces genetic algorithms and their terminology and describes two provocative applications in detail. The second and third chapters look at the use of genetic algorithms in machine learning (computer programs, data analysis and prediction, neural networks) and in scientific models (interactions among learning, evolution, and culture; sexual selection; ecosystems; evolutionary activity). Several approaches to the theory of genetic algorithms are discussed in depth in the fourth chapter. The fifth chapter takes up implementation, and the last chapter poses some currently unanswered questions and surveys prospects for the future of evolutionary computation.},

	abstract = {Fitness proportionate selection, also known as roulette wheel selection, is a genetic operator used in genetic algorithms for selecting potentially useful solutions for recombination.
In fitness proportionate selection, as in all selection methods, the fitness function assigns a fitness to possible solutions or chromosomes.  This fitness level is used to associate a probability of selection with each individual chromosome. If

          p

                Σ

                  =

    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle p\_\{i\}=\{{\textbackslash}frac \{f\_\{i\}\}\{{\textbackslash}Sigma \_\{j=1\}{\textasciicircum}\{N\}f\_\{j\}\}\},\}
  where 
  
    
      
        N
      
    
    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle N\}
   is the number of individuals in the population.
This could be imagined similar to a Roulette wheel in a casino. Usually a proportion of the wheel is assigned to each of the possible selections based on their fitness value. This could be achieved by dividing the fitness of a selection by the total fitness of all the selections, thereby normalizing them to 1. Then a random selection is made similar to how the roulette wheel is rotated.
While candidate solutions with a higher fitness will be less likely to be eliminated, there is still a chance that they may be eliminated because their probability of selection is less than 1 (or 100\%).  Contrast this with a less sophisticated selection algorithm, such as truncation selection, which will eliminate a fixed percentage of the weakest candidates. With fitness proportionate selection there is a chance some weaker solutions may survive the selection process. This is because even though the probability that the weaker solutions will survive is low, it is not zero which means it is still possible they will survive; this is an advantage, because there is a chance that even weak solutions may have some features or characteristics which could prove useful following the recombination process.
The analogy to a roulette wheel can be envisaged by imagining a roulette wheel in which each candidate solution represents a pocket on the wheel; the size of the pockets are proportionate to the probability of selection of the solution.  Selecting N chromosomes from the population is equivalent to playing N games on the roulette wheel, as each candidate is drawn independently.
Other selection techniques, such as stochastic universal sampling or tournament selection, are often used in practice. This is because they have less stochastic noise, or are fast, easy to implement and have a constant selection pressure.The naive implementation is carried out by first generating the cumulative probability distribution (CDF) over the list of individuals using a probability proportional to the fitness of the individual. A uniform random number from the range [0,1) is chosen and the inverse of the CDF for that number gives an individual. This corresponds to the roulette ball falling in the bin of an individual with a probability proportional to its width. The "bin" corresponding to the inverse of the uniform random number can be found most quickly by using a binary search over the elements of the CDF. It takes in the O(log n) time to choose an individual. A faster alternative that generates individuals in O(1) time will be to use the alias method.
Recently, a very simple algorithm was introduced that is based on "stochastic acceptance". The algorithm randomly selects an individual (say 
  
    
      
        i
      
    
    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle i\}
  ) and accepts the selection with probability 
  
    
      
        
          f
          
            i
          
        
        
          /
        
        
          f
          
            M
          
        
      
    
    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle f\_\{i\}/f\_\{M\}\}
  , where 
  
    
      
        
          f
          
            M
          
        
      
    
    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle f\_\{M\}\}
   is the maximum fitness in the population. Certain analysis indicates that the stochastic acceptance version has a considerably better performance than versions based on linear or binary search, especially in applications where fitness values might change during the run. While the behavior of this algorithm is typically fast, some fitness distributions (such as exponential distributions) may require 
  
    
      
        O
        (
        n
        )
      
    
    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle O(n)\}
   iterations in the worst case. This algorithm also requires more random numbers than binary search.},

	abstract = {Tournament selection is a method of selecting an individual from a population of individuals in a genetic algorithm. Tournament selection involves running several "tournaments" among a few individuals (or "chromosomes") chosen at random from the population.  The winner of each tournament (the one with the best fitness) is selected for crossover.  Selection pressure, a probabilistic measure of a chromosome's likelihood of participation in the tournament based on the participant selection pool size, is easily adjusted by changing the tournament size, the reason is that if the tournament size is larger, weak individuals have a smaller chance to be selected, because, if a weak individual is selected to be in a tournament, there is a higher probability that a stronger individual is also in that tournament.
The tournament selection method may be described in pseudo code:

choose k (the tournament size) individuals from the population at random
choose the best individual from the tournament with probability p
choose the second best individual with probability p*(1-p)
choose the third best individual with probability p*((1-p){\textasciicircum}2)
and so on

Deterministic tournament selection selects the best individual (when p = 1) in any tournament. A 1-way tournament (k = 1) selection is equivalent to random selection. There are two variants of the selection: with and without replacement. The variant without replacement guarantees that when selecting N individuals from a population of N elements, each individual participates in exactly k tournaments. An algorithm is proposed in . Note that depending on the number of elements selected, selection without replacement does not guarantee that no individual is selected more than once. It just guarantees that each individual has an equal chance of participating in the same number of tournaments.
In comparison with the (stochastic) fitness proportionate selection method, tournament selection is often implemented in practice due to its lack of stochastic noise.Tournament selection has several benefits over alternative selection methods for genetic algorithms (for example, fitness proportionate selection and reward-based selection): it is efficient to code, works on parallel architectures and allows the selection pressure to be easily adjusted.  Tournament selection has also been shown to be independent of the scaling of the genetic algorithm fitness function (or 'objective function') in some classifier systems.},

The objective is to find routes for the vehicles to service all the customers at a minimal cost without violating the capacity and travel time constraints of the vehicles and the time window constraints set by the customers. Approach: We proposed a genetic algorithm using an optimized crossover operator designed by a complete undirected bipartite graph that finds an optimal set of delivery routes satisfying the requirements and giving minimal total cost. Various techniques have also been introduced into the proposed algorithm to further enhance the solutions quality. Results: We tested our algorithm with benchmark instances and compared it with some other heuristics in the literature. The results showed that the proposed algorithm is competitive in terms of the quality of the solutions found. Conclusion/Recommendations: This study presented a genetic algorithm for solving vehicle routing problem with time windows using an optimized crossover operator. From the results, it can be concluded that the proposed algorithm is competitive when compared with other heuristics in the literature.},

	abstract = {Evolutionary algorithm research and applications began over 50 years ago. Like other artificial intelligence techniques, evolutionary algorithms will likely see increased use and development due to the increased availability of computation, more robust and available open source software libraries, and the increasing demand for artificial intelligence techniques. As these techniques become more adopted and capable, it is the right time to take a perspective of their ability to integrate into society and the human processes they intend to augment. In this review, we explore a new taxonomy of evolutionary algorithms and resulting classifications that look at five main areas: the ability to manage the control of the environment with limiters, the ability to explain and repeat the search process, the ability to understand input and output causality within a solution, the ability to manage algorithm bias due to data or user design, and lastly, the ability to add corrective measures. These areas are motivated by today's pressures on industry to conform to both societies concerns and new government regulatory rules. As many reviews of evolutionary algorithms exist, after motivating this new taxonomy, we briefly classify a broad range of algorithms and identify areas of future research.},

A GA allows a population composed of many individuals to evolve under specified selection rules to a state that maximizes the "fitness" function. In that process, crossover operator plays an important role. To comprehend the GAs as a whole, it is necessary to understand the role of a crossover operator. Today, there are a number of different crossover operators that can be used in GAs. However, how to decide what operator to use for solving a problem? A number of test functions with various levels of difficulty has been selected as a test polygon for determine the performance of crossover operators. In this paper, a novel crossover operator called 'ring crossover' is proposed. In order to evaluate the efficiency and feasibility of the proposed operator, a comparison between the results of this study and results of different crossover operators used in GAs is made through a number of test functions with various levels of difficulty.

These operators include parent selection, crossover and mutation. Selection is one of the important operations in the GA process. There are several ways for selection. This paper presents the comparison of GA performance in solving travelling salesman problem (TSP) using different parent selection strategy. Several TSP instances were tested and the results show that tournament selection strategy outperformed proportional roulette wheel and rankbased roulette wheel selections, achieving best solution quality with low computing times. Results also reveal that tournament and proportional roulette wheel can be superior to the rankbased roulette wheel selection for smaller problems only and become susceptible to premature convergence as problem size increases.},

This versatility is achieved by trying to avoid task-speciﬁc engineering and therefore disregarding a lot of prior knowledge. Instead of exploiting man-made input features carefully optimized for each task, our system learns internal representations on the basis of vast amounts of mostly unlabeled training data. This work is then used as a basis for building a freely available tagging system with good performance and minimal computational requirements.},
